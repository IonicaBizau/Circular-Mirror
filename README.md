Circular mirror
==============

Still experimental...

Thank you for [mixedmath](http://math.stackexchange.com/users/9754/mixedmath)'s suggestion: "You are essentially asking how to find the intersection points of two circles, right?" ([link](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/344052/intersection-of-chord-with-circle-knowing-the-length-and-a-point/351903#comment740176_344052))

What can be more beautiful than this system of equations?
